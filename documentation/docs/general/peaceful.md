# Peaceful Mode

Have ever playing Minecraft in Peaceful Mode? Like it's name, peaceful, means no Hostile Mob, which is good. You doesn't need to kill any zombie again, die because of Creeper's Explosion, poison from cave spider, etc. Any neutral mob are now friendly, they will not attacking you when you punch them accidentally.

Peaceful give you unlimited regeneration (Likely level 2), which is you doesn't need care about your health (But still you can die). Player's hunger never depleate, means that you don't need to kill any passive mob again (~~Vegetarian will happy~~)

Most of you think, the peaceful was the easiest mode in Minecraft. Well... NO. Although you doesn't need to kill hostile mob, but some mob drop useful item, such as Blaze Rod and Ender Pearl for go to the End. But in Peaceful mode, you can't go to the End, means no elytra and shulker.

## Hostile Mobs

Peaceful means no hostile mob. That's mean some item unobtainable, which is not good. Here a list of mob with their loot perspective:
